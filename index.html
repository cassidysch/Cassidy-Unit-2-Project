        <h2> All over the world, temperatures are rising and icebergs are melting, but why? </h2>

        <p> Whenever you use something that requires a fossil fuel, or fuels made from decomposing animals and plants, like your car, you release a gas into the environment. The Earth is naturally able to absorb heat from the sun and release in back out as infared radiation, but these excess gases in the atmosphere slow down the loss of heat and result in overall higher temperatures.</p>

        <h2> Unsustainable vs. Sustainable </h2>

        <p> For quite a while, our energy has come from steam turbines. Coal gets shoveled into a boiler and burns, creating a hot steam. This steam enters the turbine and the spinning blades cool it down while also releasing energy. This spins the blades and thus perpetuating the spinning turbine. This is used to generate electricity to power things anywhere from lights to computers. This sounds like a great source of energy, but it is in fact unsustainable. When the coal is burned and releases the steam, it is released into the atmosphere and leads to an increase in global temperatures. Coal is also a limited resource, which means that some day, we'll run out.</p>

        <p> There are a number of alternative sustainable energy sources that utilize the resources that we'll never run out of. Solar panels are a great option and absorb sun rays to generate electricity. These can be installed in fields as solar farms to power an entire area or on roofs to power individual homes. Wind turbines are placed in fields and the wind is able to turn the turbines in order to generate electricity. Both of these options are extremely helpful, but there is a gap period between 4pm and 9pm when wind turbines experience low wind speeds and when solar panels aren't getting enough sun where the power grid has to resort to less sustainble sources. </p>

        <h2> Who does this affect? </h2>

        <p> You may believe that global warming will only affect certain areas of the world if your area has not yet seen any consequences, but the harsh truth is that every single living thing on Earth will be affected. Many organisms are at risk of facing extinction if the Earth continues to heat up, as well. Some are unable to handle temperatures any hotter than their current environments and for others, the changing temperatures will heavily alter their environments and will eventually render them uninhabitable. <br> <br> Humans will also face a lot of troubles as a result of climate change and rising temperatures. Since large ice bergs need low temperatures to stay solid, they will begin to melt into the ocean and cause the sea level to rise. Several coastal cities will have to evacuate and move farther inland. Natural disasters will start to rise in frequency and intensity, which would seriously hurt places that are already hurting a lot from the normal natural disasters they have to face. </p>

        <h2> How you can help </h2>

        <p> With all of this unmotivating talk of the effects, you might feel like you're powerless in the face of climate change. In fact, there are many things you can do to slow climate change. Things like using less electricity during 4pm - 9pm when energy use is at it's highest, taking public transporation options instead of taking your car, and buying energy-smart kitchenware and light bulbs can be very helpful. Even though your individual contribution won't change the course of climate change, we can rally together and make a collective effort to be more sustainble. </p>
